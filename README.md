## Getting Started

### Installation

[Download] this repo, extract it to some folder, say `my-app`, and run:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
```

### Development

Run this to start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app in browser.

### Testing

Run this to test your app:

```bash
npm test
```

Run this to generate coverage report:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

Coverage report will be placed inside the `coverage` folder.

### Production

Run this to build and optimize your app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiled files will be placed inside the `build` folder.

Run this to serve your build:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open http://localhost:5000/ to see your app in browser.

##### Commands

| Command | Description |

### Directory Structure

This is the initial directory structure:

```
my-app
├── app
│   ├── App/
│   ├── Counter/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── reducers.js
│   └── store.js
├── config/
├── public
│   └── favicon.ico
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

#### `app`

`app` directory contains the source code of your app. The main entry point for your app is `app/index.js`. Styles can be placed inside `app/styles` directory. Paths to compiled `js` and `css` files will be automatically injected into `app/index.html`.

#### `build`

`build` directory is created when you run `npm run build`. It contains the compiled output of your app which can be run by a browser.

#### `config`

`config` directory contains your app's config files. Webpack config is in `config/webpack.js` and Jest config is in `config/jest.js`. Babel and ESLint config is inside `package.json`.

#### `coverage`

`coverage` directory is created when you run `npm run coverage`. It contains the coverage report generated by Jest.

#### `public`

 Static files like `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt` etc., can be placed inside `public` directory. Contents of this directory are copied to the `build` directory.

#### `package.json`

`package.json` contains the list of scripts and libraries required to build and run your app. It also contains Babel and ESLint config under `"babel"` and `"eslintConfig"` keys respectively.
